# Regex: What is it?

Regex or regular expressions are a sequence of characters that form a search pattern. They are used to match character combinations in strings. For example; you can test a string for a character to verify that a phone number is valid.
## Summary

The regex code that I will be describing for you here is 
(\W|^)po[#\-]{0,1}\s{0,1}\d{2}[\s-]{0,1}\d{4}(\W|$) 
This is a regular expression that matches and alphanumeric format, so it can match order numbers for example.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors tell the computer when the regex starts and ends so that it knows what sit's looking for

$ = tells the computer this is the end of the expression.

### Quantifiers

Quantifies specify for the computer how many instances of a character, group, or class should be present for the expression to find it.
The quantifiers in this expression include =
