# Regex: What is it?

Regex or regular expressions are a sequence of characters that form a search pattern. They are used to match character combinations in strings. For example; you can test a string for a character to verify that a phone number is valid.
## Summary

The regex code that I will be describing for you here is 
```(\W|^)po[#\-]{0,1}\s{0,1}\d{2}[\s-]{0,1}\d{4}(\W|$)```
This is a regular expression that matches and alphanumeric format, so it can match order numbers for example.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors tell the computer when the regex starts and ends so that it knows what sit's looking for
```^``` = tells the computer this is the beginning of the of the expression.
```$``` = tells the computer this is the end of the expression.

### Quantifiers

Quantifies specify for the computer how many instances of a character, group, or class should be present for the expression to find it.
The quantifiers in this expression include = 
```{0,1}``` this means it needs to Match from 0 to 1 times, 
'```{2}``` which means it needs to match exactly 2 times,
'```{4}``` which means it needs to match exactly 4 times

### OR Operator

The OR Operator, also know as the alternation (also not called O.R., it is called or). It is written with ```|```. There is two in this expression one at the beginning and at the end. 

### Character Classes

A character class is a special notation that matches any symbol from the set. The character classes used in this expression are:

```\d``` A digit: a character from 0 to 9. 

```\s```A space symbol: includes spaces, tabs \t, newlines \n and few other rare characters, such as \v, \f and \r.

```\W``` is an inverse class Non-wordly character: anything but \w, e.g a non-latin letter or a space.

### Flags

Flags are tokens that modify the expressions behavior of the search. This expression has no flags but I will include an example.
```i``` is ignore casing, it makes the expression search case-insensitively.

### Grouping and Capturing

Capturing groups is what is used to mark multiple characters into a group or unit. You can use this to apply modifers to them. 
The ones used in this expression are:
```(\W|^)``` and ```(\W|$)```

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions are a list of characters enclosed by ‘[’ and ‘]’. It matches any single character in that list. There are none used in this regex

### Greedy and Lazy Match

'Greedy' means to match the longest possible string, the expression will find every exact character you tell it to. and 'Lazy' means to match the shortest possible string. Adding a ```?``` makes it optional and therefore lazy. We have no lazy matches in our expression. We have several greedy matches; for example; ```{0,1}``` it will find this exact match.

### Boundaries

### Back-references

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
